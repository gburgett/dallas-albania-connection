2021 is a new year!  As we work to get back to normal in America, we're also
working towards getting back to normal with the Albania-Dallas connection!

We've been invited to join our Albanian friends in September of this year to
minister to high-school students as they start the school year.  We will also
commence the Re:Gen group that has been continuing with us since last year, and
launch several more Re:Gen groups!

If you've been itching for a chance to get back to Albania, or to come for the
first time, we'd love for you to apply!  If you are not able to come with us this
year, your support is especially meaningful to us.  Please consider praying for
us and [supporting us financially](https://watermark.gomethod.app/!/#/20984/albania-september-2021/donate)
