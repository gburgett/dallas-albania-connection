What a year huh?  Way back in January we were planning our biggest trip yet.  With
multiple teams and multiple projects in Albania and Hungary, we were excited to 
get back into the swing of things and planning for an exciting summer.

And then God sent COVID-19.  Cancelling the trips this summer had us feeling
really down:

</div>

### But wait!

There's a purpose in everything God does!  Though we were sad to not see our
friends during the summer, we have kept in touch with them through a weekly
Zoom call.  Through this weekly touchpoint, and God's provision, we now have an
opportunity to send a small team in October!

The team will spend 1 week in Tirana helping the High School ministry with their
outreach.  Then, over the weekend, we will help introduce [Watermark's re:generation
curriculum](http://www.regenerationrecovery.org) to the leaders of CRU Albania.
Most of our team has been through re:gen and seen the difference that biblical
recovery can make in our lives, and we're exited to see how it can help our
friends!

### The team

4 of us will be going in person, while 10 more will join us remotely via video
conference.  We also have one person already in-country, our dear friend
Marlie Austin who is spending the year teaching with [the GDQ International
school in Tirana](http://gdqschool.org/)!

### Safety

Why would we travel during a global pandemic?  Because God is Sovereign even
over disease.  We love our friends.  And we don't want to waste any opportunity
that God sets before us.  If God is moving in Albania, what else could be more
important?

Of course that's not license to be reckless.  We are taking plenty of precautions
to make sure we don't accidentally spread a deadly virus to our friends.  Here
is a list of some of the precautions we are taking:

* Personal quarantine with limited interaction with others outside of the home performed 2 weeks before leaving and limited interaction with others 2 weeks upon returning home. 
*	In country - strict social distancing rules apply including wearing of masks indoors.
*	No Large Group activities (groups will be small in nature - approx 10 people or less).

In addition, we will cancel the trip if any of the following occurs:

*	If the US government raises the travel warning again to Level 4 (Currently it is on Level 3).
*	If the Albanian Government requires a 14 day in-country quarantine or any other quarantine preventing a team member to go back to the USA on time.
*	If the Albanian Government goes back to Shelter in Place restrictions.
*	If guidance from Watermark, Cru City, or Cru Albania changes and they no longer support us to take a trip.
*	Other unforeseen events occurring which would exceed the risk amount we are currently taking.

### Please pray!

We need your prayers because ultimately the success of this trip is not up to us.
If God doesn't move in the hearts of high schoolers, or if He doesn't give us
gracious and understanding hearts during the re:gen process, then all of this is
for nothing.  So please, please ask Him to pour out His blessing on this trip.

> Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
> Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are 
> evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your 
> Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
