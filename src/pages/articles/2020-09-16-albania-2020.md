What a year huh?  Way back in January we were planning our biggest trip yet.  With
multiple teams and multiple projects in Albania and Hungary, we were excited to 
get back into the swing of things and planning for an exciting summer.

And then God sent COVID-19.  Cancelling the trips this summer had us feeling
really down:

### But wait!

There's a purpose in everything God does!  Though we were sad to not see our
friends during the summer, we have kept in touch with them through a weekly
Zoom call.  Through this weekly touchpoint, and God's provision, we got an
opportunity to send a small team in October!

Our team was able to spend 1 week in Tirana helping the High School ministry with their
outreach.  Then, over the weekend, we helped introduce [Watermark's re:generation
curriculum](http://www.regenerationrecovery.org) to the leaders of CRU Albania.
Most of our team has been through re:gen and seen the difference that biblical
recovery can make in our lives, and we're exited to see how it can help our
friends!

With the high school team, we were able to share the Gospel to over 50 students
during our Saturday Afternoon meeting, as well as connect with and encourage many
students throughout the week.  We took a trip out to Elbasan and Peqin as well,
to encourage many students there in their faith!

Over the weekend at the Re:Gen retreat, we each shared our testimonies with our 
Albanian friends who are in CRU Leadership.  We got to share about the benefit
we have seen in our lives from going through Re:Gen.  While we recognize that
Re:Gen is not the Gospel, because we care about our friends we desired to share
this tool with them.  Since we've returned, 4 couples have decided to go through
the year long curriculum with us!

### The team

Despite challenges with passports, and Covid exposure, 4 of us were able to go
in person!  The other 10 joined us remotely via video conference.  We also joined
 one person already in-country, our dear friend
Marlie Austin who is spending the year teaching with [the GDQ International
school in Tirana](http://gdqschool.org/)!

Here is the whole team that participated this year:
* Will Noll
* Gordon Burgett
* Allye Foster
* Matt Rial
* Chris Hyland
* Madison McGill
* Marc Flores
* Joseph Woodard
* Amy Smith
* Jason Smith
* Carrie Beckner
* Stephanie Sims
* Joanne Gray
* Morgan Asbill

### Safety

Why would we travel during a global pandemic?  Because God is Sovereign even
over disease.  We love our friends.  And we don't want to waste any opportunity
that God sets before us.  If God is moving in Albania, what else could be more
important?

Of course that's not license to be reckless.  We have taken plenty of precautions
to make sure we don't accidentally spread a deadly virus to our friends.  We spent
the two weeks leading up to departure under a voluntary "stay at home" directive.

Even despite our precautions, one member of our team contracted Covid before the trip.
By God's grace, he recovered in time to comply with the CDC's guidelines of 10 days
isolation post-symptoms, and was able to still go on the trip!  Those closest to
him also got tested, and none of them ever caught the virus.  During this whole
event we were in close contact with CRU, Watermark leadership, and our Albanian
friends so that they were well informed, and could voice any concerns.

### Going Forward

We're excited for the next season of ministry!  Prayerfully we'll get to go
next summer as well, if the Lord wills!  As we continue helping our friends through
the Re:Gen curriculum, we're excited for the changes we'll see in their lives and
ministry as well!  Please continue praying with us!
