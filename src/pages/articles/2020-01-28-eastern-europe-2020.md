This summer and fall we are looking for people like YOU!

We are intentionally engaged in encouraging and discipling our partners, just as they encourage and disciple us. We are experiencing the "unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" that Paul talks about in Ephesians 4:

> “There is one body and one Spirit, just as you too were called to the one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.” – Ephesians 4:4-6
