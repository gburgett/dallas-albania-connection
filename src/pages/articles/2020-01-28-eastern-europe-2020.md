This summer and fall we are looking for people like YOU!

We are intentionally engaged in encouraging and discipling our partners, just as they encourage and disciple us. We are experiencing the "unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" that Paul talks about in Ephesians 4:

> “There is one body and one Spirit, just as you too were called to the one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.” – Ephesians 4:4-6

This sharing of lives has already led to many opportunities to see people be transformed by the power of the Gospel.  This is not just a one-time trip.  We are having a lasting impact with and through our overseas partners.


We'd love for you to join us this year in:
###### Discipleship
* 6 weeks of training culminating in an international discipleship trip
* Doing Unashamed together in the Spring
* Team-building and having fun together

###### Prayer
* Praying together for the souls we will encounter overseas.
* Praying for the groups as they travel & minister together
* Praying with our ministry partners for the future success of our shared ministries.

###### 4 Summer teams to Albania
* High School summer camps
* Recovery ministry

###### 3 Fall trips
* High school outreach in Albania at the beginning of the school year
* Young Professionals ministry in Albania
* Mixed Evangelism in Hungary

**Text "Albania" to 214-444-7523 to keep up to date!**
