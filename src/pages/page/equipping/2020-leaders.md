## Overview

### Mission

Our desire through this leadership training is to equip you to respond with grace 
and truth in every pastoral care situation you may find yourselves in while 
leading teams in Albania.

### Purpose

Every year since the first that we've taken teams to Albania, we have had situations
come up that required peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, and self-control in
order to maintain good relationships both among the team members and with our
Albanian partners.  As a small sample, some of these situations have included:

- Conflict in a dating relationship
- Conflict between team members and Albanian partners
- Direct requests to "tone down" a person's testimony
- Racism
- Obnoxious/loud behavior at the hotel causing issues with hotel owner
- Poor communication during traveling leading to added stress on leaders

As a team leader, these kinds of situations fall on you to respond with grace
and truth.  How will you go about "keep[ing] the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of Peace" (Ephesians 4:3)?  How will you discern when "it's not wrong, it's just 
different" conflicts with Biblical Truth?

### Vision

The Directional team would like to join you in a 6-week topical bible study
based on Watermark's "3C Training".  The curriculum will be self-study with
discussion during group time.  Each week will consist of you in your self-study
preparing to teach the rest of us *from the Bible* on the topic assigned for
that week.  During group discussion, individuals will be randomly chosen to
present their teaching and receive critical feedback from the rest.

Through this training you will learn how to present and defend Biblical truth
clearly, concicesly, compellingly, conversationally, and with conviction.  You
will be sharpened when your speech is not "full of grace, seasoned with salt"
(Colossians 4:6), or when you are teaching man's opinion and not God's revealed
truth (Galatians 1:11-12).  You will learn how to reach for the Bible and draw
answers from it, "... always being ready to make a defense... with gentleness 
and respect" (1 Peter 3:15).
