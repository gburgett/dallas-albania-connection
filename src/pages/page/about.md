We are a group of people who are passionate about sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ with others in Albania and across Eastern Europe. We are imperfect persons who have been redeemed by a perfect God.

Our home base is Dallas, TX, but we have many friends in other cities across Texas and the world. 

**Mission**: We seek to follow Christ as he leads us to make him known among people in Albania and across Eastern Europe. 

**Vision**: Submitted to God, we are changing the world through the lives of Christ-followers.
