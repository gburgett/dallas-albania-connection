We are a group of people who are passionate about sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ with others in Albania and across Eastern Europe. We are imperfect persons who have been redeemed by a perfect God.

Our home base is Dallas, Texas, but we have many friends in other cities across Texas, the US, and the world. 

**Mission**

> We are building deep relationships in and beyond Albania  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;through mutual discipleship and partnering in evangelism  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the fulfillment of the Great Commission.
