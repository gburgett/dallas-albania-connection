We are a group of people who are passionate about sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ with others in Albania and across Eastern Europe. We are imperfect persons who have been redeemed by a perfect God.

Our home base is Dallas, Texas, but we have many friends in other cities across Texas, the US, and the world. 

**Mission**

We seek to follow Christ as he leads us to make him known among people in Albania and across Eastern Europe. 

**Vision**

Submitted to God, we are changing the world through the gospel!
