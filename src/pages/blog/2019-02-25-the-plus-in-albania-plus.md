What does the '+' mean in Albania+?

## High School +

Every year since 2015 we've added more projects and more people.  It started out
when Kaon Serjani, then the director of High School ministries for CRU Albania,
invited us to take a team to Elbasan.  We added in 2016 a team to KorÃ§a, as well
as a team to work with Young Professionals in the capital city.  We've done this
because the CRU staff invited us.  The projects were well-planned and executed.
We continue to see fruit in the lives of kids and young adults whom we've impacted
through these projects.

So does the '+' mean more people?  Yes, but not primarily...

## Albania +

In 2017, we added two new locations outside Albania.  We began going to Poland and
Hungary to work with CRU staff there.  This was not a random decision - we were
invited by people whom we had met and developed relations with in each of the
countries.  There was a desire for us to participate with them, and there were
leaders excited to carry the torch.

Randy Valdez did an excellent job carrying the torch for us in Hungary.  He knew
the culture, having spent 8 months living there at one point.  We partnered with
the Catalytic team to share the Gospel in a town where CRU did not have an ongoing
presence.  The Catalytic team was then able to equip believers there to continue
evangelizing and discipling their own neighbors.

Wes Chick, Chris Hyland, and Lauren Horner (now Lauren Noll) did an excellent job
in Poland bringing the Re:Generation program to the Polish CRU staff.  This is
something they had asked us for, having seen it in action here in Dallas.  Leadership
in Poland was on-board, and the people who attended the camp were willing to go
all-in on the program.  If a project is like this, there's no question we will
do whatever we can to help it succeed.

So does the '+' mean more countries?  Yes, but not primarily...

## Summer Projects +

Two of our members have now spent years living in Albania, and more have expressed
a desire to.  I (Gordon Burgett) spent two years in the STINT program with the
Young Professionals ministry, leveraging my experience as a volunteer at The Porch
to help young adults in Albania reach their peers in the workplace.  Lauren Dean
has spent two years and is planning on a third as the librarian at the international
school, where she disciples the kids of missionaries with her day job and disciples
some of the women in the young adults ministry with her free time.  We have been
and are continuing to build deep relationships through shared life with the Albanian
people.

In Poland, the Re:Gen project did not end when the team came back home.  Several
of our team have been meeting over Google Hangouts once a week with the Polish
Re:Generation small groups that launched out of the project week.  In addition,
they are working to translate the Re:Gen materials into Polish.  This ongoing
effort has earned the respect of the Polish CRU staff and built deep relationships
with our friends in Poland.

So does the '+' mean more months of the year, not just summer projects?  Yes,
but not primarily...

## The strategy behind the +

The '+' means that we are committed to going deeper in our relationships with
the staff with whom we have been in contact.  We are encouraging and discipling
them, just as they encourage and disciple us.  We are experiencing the "unity of
the Spirit in the bond of peace" that Paul talks about in Ephesians 4:

> 4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you too were called to the one hope
> of your calling, 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6 one God and Father of all,
> who is over all and through all and in all.
> <span class="source"><a href="https://biblehub.com/net/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a></span>

John Stott, in his book [Christian Mission in the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Mission-Modern-World-Stott/dp/0830844392), describes the difference between activities with a missionary *dimension*
and activities with a missionary *intention*.  Those with a missionary *dimension*
are activities that create strong believers who as a byproduct will go and share the Gospel,
while those with a missionary *intention* are the ones whose express, direct purpose
is evangelism and as a byproduct create strong believers.
Things like Re:Generation are activities with a missionary *dimension*, while the
summer projects in Albania & Hungary are activities with a missionary *intention*.

As the church in Albania, Hungary, and Poland grows, it will begin to take over
from CRU more and more of the activities with a missionary *dimension* freeing CRU
up to focus wholly on activities with a missionary *intention*.  Watermark is
well-positioned to support the church in these activities, and we as a team are
well-positioned to be the bridge, offering the resources that Watermark makes available
and adapting them to the cultures of the countries where we have these partnerships.
Re:Generation is just the beginning, there are so many more ways that we as the
body at Watermark can resource and equip Albanian, Hungarian, and Polish churches.

In the process, our members will also grow spiritually and be equipped as "apostles,
prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers" (Ephesians 4:11).  This is also part
of the '+', and not to be taken lightly.  "therefore you who teach someone else,
do you not teach yourself?" (Romans 2:21a)

Thus, our mission statement:

> We are building deep relationships with believers and non-believers in Albania and beyond,  
>  through mutual discipleship and partnering in Evangelism,  
>    for the fulfillment of the Great Comission in our respective cities. 

We are excited for this mission.  And we are praying for more, greater, deeper, '+'.
Holding fast to the promises of God, we are patiently and actively waiting for Him
to reveal to us the next '+'.  As we go on the projects this summer, we have this
vision in mind.  Through our conversations, actions, and relationships we will
strive to run the race well and complete the Great Commision, using all the tools
at our disposal, both those with a missionary *intention* and those with a missionary
*dimension*.
