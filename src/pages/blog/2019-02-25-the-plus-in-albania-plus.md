It's now the 7th year in a row that we've sent a team from Watermark to Albania.
We've grown a lot in that time, from 3 people in 2013 to almost 40 in 2019.  But
what have we learned, what have we gained from continuing to do this?  What has
been the reason for growth, the purpose behind all this effort, the continued
*Mission* that we have there?  Why do we ask people to support us in this?

As we've grown, we've also had to expand our brand.  No longer just Team Albania,
we have become **Albania+ Eastern Europe**.  So why the '+'?  What does it mean
to us?  Does it mean -

1. '+' more countries (Hungary, Poland, and beyond)?
2. '+' more audiences beyond High School?
3. '+' more seasons, not just CRU Summer Projects?
4. '+' more partners, i.e. churches and individuals whose hearts are fully Christ's?

It encompasses all these things, but it's deeper than that.

<span class="callout">For the impatient, [skip to our mission statement](#mission-statement)</span>

### 1. More Countries

In 2017, we added two new locations outside Albania.  We began going to Poland and
Hungary to work with CRU staff there.  This was not a random decision - we were
invited by people whom we had met and developed relations with in each of the
countries.  There was a desire for us to participate with them, and there were
leaders excited to carry the torch - Randy Valdez in Hungary and Will Noll &
Chris Hyland in Poland.


### 2. More Audiences

Every year since 2015 we've added more projects and more people.  It started out
when Kaon Serjani, then the director of High School ministries for CRU Albania,
invited us to take a team to Elbasan.  We added in 2016 a team to KorÃ§a, as well
as a team to work with Young Professionals in the capital city.  We've done this
because the CRU staff invited us. We continue to see fruit in the lives of kids
and young adults whom we've impacted through these projects.


### 3. More Seasons

Two of our members have now spent years living in Albania, and more have expressed
a desire to.  I (Gordon Burgett) spent two years in the STINT program with the
Young Professionals ministry, leveraging my experience as a volunteer at The Porch
to help young adults in Albania reach their peers in the workplace.  Lauren Dean
has spent two years and is planning on a third as the librarian at the international
school, where she disciples the kids of missionaries with her day job and disciples
some of the women in the young adults ministry with her free time.  We have been
and are continuing to build deep relationships through shared life with the Albanian
people.

In Poland, the Re:Gen project did not end when the team came back home.  Several
of our team have been meeting over Google Hangouts once a week with the Polish
Re:Generation small groups that launched out of the project week.  In addition,
they are working to translate the Re:Gen materials into Polish.  This ongoing
effort has earned the respect of the Polish CRU staff and built deep relationships
with our friends in Poland.

### 4. More Partners

In 2017, we invited 5 members of Cornerstone Church Albania to come to Watermark's
Church Leadership Conference.  We saw an opportunity to invest in some lay-leaders
who wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity to attend a conference of that sort.
After the conference, they expressed a desire to form more authentic small groups
at Cornerstone church.  This led to a mens' small group conference in December of
2017 that we were invited to speak at.

Lauren Dean and I (Gordon Burgett) have also joined this church multiple times at
their annual all-church retreat in Vlora.  We have been able to build deeper
relationships with the members through that church retreat, many of whom are CRU
staff.  We have been encouraging them to *be* the church in their communities.

## The strategy behind the +

I hope you've noticed how often I've used the word "relationship" in the above
paragraphs.  *This* is the heart of what the '+' means. We are intentionally engaged
in encouraging and discipling our partners, just as they encourage and disciple us.
We are experiencing the "unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" that Paul talks
about in Ephesians 4:

> 4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you too were called to the one hope
> of your calling, 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6 one God and Father of all,
> who is over all and through all and in all.
> <span class="source"><a href="https://biblehub.com/net/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a></span>

Thanks to these deep relationships, we are putting ourselves in position to support
the church in Albania.  As the church in Albania, Hungary, and Poland grows, it
will begin to take over from CRU more and more of the activities which do not have
a specific missionary *intention*, freeing CRU up to focus wholly on those activities.

This term was coined by John Stott, in his book [Christian Mission in the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Mission-Modern-World-Stott/dp/0830844392).
He highlights the difference between activities with a missionary *dimension*
and activities with a missionary *intention*  Those with a missionary *dimension*
are activities that create strong believers who as a byproduct will go and share the Gospel,
while those with a missionary *intention* are the ones whose express, direct purpose
is evangelism and as a byproduct create strong believers.
Things like Re:Generation are activities with a missionary *dimension*, while the
summer projects in Albania & Hungary are activities with a missionary *intention*.

Watermark is well-positioned to support the global church in these activities,
and we as a team are well-positioned to be the bridge, offering the resources
that Watermark makes available and adapting them to the cultures of the countries
where we have these partnerships. Re:Generation is just the beginning, there are
so many more ways that we as the body at Watermark can resource and equip our
Albanian, Hungarian, and Polish friends.

In the process, our members will also grow spiritually and be equipped as "apostles,
prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers" (Ephesians 4:11).  This is also part
of the '+', and not to be taken lightly.  "therefore you who teach someone else,
do you not teach yourself?" (Romans 2:21a)

This leads us to...
## Our Mission Statement:


> We are building deep relationships with believers and non-believers in Albania and beyond,  
>  through mutual discipleship and partnering in Evangelism,  
>    for the fulfillment of the Great Comission in our respective cities. 

We are excited for this mission.  And we are praying for more, greater, deeper, '+'.
Holding fast to the promises of God, we are patiently and actively waiting for Him
to reveal to us the next '+'.  As we go on the projects this summer, we have this
vision in mind.  Through our conversations, actions, and relationships we will
strive to run the race well and complete the Great Commision, using all the tools
at our disposal, both those with a missionary *intention* and those with a missionary
*dimension*.
